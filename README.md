## 12. Energy

Add the _energy_ concept:
- the builder produces energy

## 13. Upgrade towers

Choose the tower you want to build
Add different tower types (+ missiles):

A tower can be upgraded (improve GUI)

## 14. Add predefined levels (TODO)

Create predefined levels (Beginner / Intermediate):
- map
- initial money
- mob generation  

Select the level you want to play (display a preview)

## Ideas (TODO)

- PWA
- Improve paths with smooth angles
- Rotate the towers
- Rotate the mobs
- Try to reduce polygons (group adjacent walls into one larger rectangular wall)
- Overview of the map in a corner
- Collision detection missiles / walls (higher difficulty mode)
